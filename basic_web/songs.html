Hey, hey
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
(Oh, oh)

I, I'm doin' this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey, baby, come on
I loved you endlessly
And you weren't there for me
So now, it's time to leave
And make it alone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
Might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

(Oh, oh)

You just hit me with the truth
Now, girl, you're more than welcome to
So, give me one good reason
Baby, come on
I lived for you and me
And now, I really come to see
That life would be much better
Once you're gone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough (Ooh, ooh)
Might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

I'm givin' up, I know for sure
I don't wanna be the reason for your love, no more
(Bye, bye)
I'm checkin' out, I'm signin' off
I don't wanna be the loser and I've had enough

I don't wanna be your fool
In this game for two
So I'm leavin' you behind
(Bye, bye, bye, yeah)
I don't wanna make it tough
(Make it though)
But I've had enough (Bye, bye)
And it ain't no lie
Bye, bye (Baby)

Don't wanna be a fool for you (I don't wanna be a fool)
Just another player in your game for two (In this game for two)

I don't wanna be a fool, but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)
Don't really wanna make it tough (Oh, oh)
(I don't wanna make it tough)
I just wanna tell you that I had enough

(But I've had enough)
Might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie

Bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)
